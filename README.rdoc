== README

A simple, DB-driven Rails website/blog.

Things I want to do:

* Blog feed
** Controller + coverage
** Caching
** RSS feed
** SEO for each post embedded into the layout
* About page
* Work page
* Contact page
* Alternate, non-homepage layout
* Abstract all copy into en.yml so people can easily swap in/out their content.
