== README

A simple, DB-driven Rails website/blog.

Things I want to do:

* Work page
* Blog feed
  * Make images look better for blog_posts#show
  * RSS feed
* Re-factor all SEO titles/keywords/descriptions into abstracted en.yml
* Re-do mobile nav the way I wanted it originally
* Clean up .scss/.sass from Gumby
