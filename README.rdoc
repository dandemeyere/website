== README

A simple, DB-driven Rails website/blog.

Things I want to do:

* Blog feed
  * Make images look better for blog_posts#show
  * Controller + coverage
  * Caching
  * RSS feed
* SEO-up all non-blog pages
* About page
* Work page
* Contact page
* Re-do mobile nav the way I wanted it originally
* Abstract all copy into en.yml so people can easily swap in/out their content.
* Clean up .scss/.sass from Gumby
